## Advice from Nic

Think about the audience:

- best audience member only pays attention 60% of the time (could be distracted or )
    - write slides so that someone can follow if they jump in and out of attentiveness
    - Always write main point on the slides (e.g. don't just throw up a picture)

- Most people probably remember only 1 or 2 sentences after a month
    - we decide what that point it and be sure to make it very clearly


Presenting stuff that isn't finished:

- Give clearest sense possible of what the overall objective is. Try to write slides so they are as close to your intended finished project as possible.
- Tom is exception -- he can listen to all the details, filter them, and have a really good sense of where the project should go
- Don't just spew out evertyhing you've done. We need to filter it into a main point we'd like to make with the research



Other:

- When trying to make a point tell a story that people find compelling and sure it is consistent with the math
